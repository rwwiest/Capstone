Overview:
My capstone is a smalle survey that asks the user for their name and then has them choose the multiple
choice answers that represent their response to a specific situation. These responses are then taken
and calculated in order to tell the user what kind of personality they have.

An explanation of how your capstone synthesizes various concepts learned throughout the year and required additional research of new concepts
pseudocode algorithms if relevant:
The capstone consists of two different classes(one viewer class and a one survey class) the code uses nearly all of the concepts that we have been working 
on for the past year like using for loops, if else statements, working with data and organizing the data, having a user interface. 
We went briefly into the use of GUIs but the scope of the class in no way covered the variety of components and necessary layout manangement information
necessary to complete the capstone. This is a good thing because it allowed me to research and actually learn new information on my own instead of being
taught by a teacher. This task was sometimes stressful but it one of the most important skills in life and programming, which is being able to self-educate 
yourself on a new topic.

Instructions to run your capstone (enumerate any dependencies or other configuration steps):
In order to run the capstone you must call the main method of the Survey Viewer. This will take care of starting the program. The user may enter in their
name in the text field(although this is not required) and answer all of the questions in the survey and then hit the submit button. Lastly, the user can
enjoy a summary of the themselves from the viewpoint of a computer.
